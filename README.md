# Advent of Code 2025

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).
I have written my submissions in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

You can find the solutions to each day in their respective files in their respective folder under `/src`. 
In each file, there will be two functions `part1()` and `part2()`, that will yield the specified solution, given the input file in the same folder named `input.txt`. 
I also explained the idea behind the solution to each part as comments in the respective files.

You can also run the solutions to all parts of all days by running the `Main.kt` file. To do this, you need Kotlin and Gradle, then just do
```bash
$ ./gradlew run
```
